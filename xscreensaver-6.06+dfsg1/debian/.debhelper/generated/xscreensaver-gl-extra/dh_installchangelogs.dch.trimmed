      were larger, to be more visible on today's higher rez displays.

    - X11: Various improvements to `xscreensaver-settings'.
    - X11: Silence new Perl warnings from `xscreensaver-getimage-file'.

      the org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver endpoint.

    - Updated `webcollage'.
    - `sphereeversion' now has corrugation-mode, and can evert the Earth.
