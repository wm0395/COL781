# Since 6.03 the original configure script returns non-zero if a
# warning about configuration options versus detected capabilities
# has been issued, presumably to increase awareness of the warnings.
# To allow building on all architectures, while relying on the
# resulting HAVE_XX flags as usual, return with success at the end
# of the script.
