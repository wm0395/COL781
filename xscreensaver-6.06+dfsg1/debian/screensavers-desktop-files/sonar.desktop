Comment=A sonar display pings (get it?) the hosts on your local network, and plots their distance (response time) from you. The three rings represent ping times of approximately 2.5, 70 and 2,000 milliseconds respectively. Alternately, it can run a simulation that doesn't involve hosts. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping#History Written by Jamie Zawinski and Stephen Martin.
