Comment=A swarm of wind-up toy robots wander around the table-top, bumping into each other. Each robot contains a mechanically accurate gear system inside, which you can see when the robot's shell occasionally fades to transparency. Also, sometimes a cartoony word bubble pops up above a robot, full of random text. Written by Jamie Zawinski.
