Comment=A mesh geodesic sphere of increasing and decreasing complexity. A geodesic sphere is an icosohedron whose equilateral faces are sub-divided into non-equilateral triangles to more closely approximate a sphere. The animation shows the equilateral triangles subdivided into four coplanar equilateral triangles; and then inflated outward, causing the sub-triangles to no longer be equilateral, but to more closely approximate the surface of a sphere. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller Written by Jamie Zawinski.
