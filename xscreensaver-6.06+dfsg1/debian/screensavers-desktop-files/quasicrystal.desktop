Comment=A quasicrystal is a structure that is ordered but aperiodic. Two-dimensional quasicrystals can be generated by adding a set of planes where x is the sine of y. Different complex aperiodic plane tilings are produced depending on the period, position, and rotation of the component planes, and whether the rotation of the planes is evenly distributed around the circle (the "symmetry" option, above) or random. See also the "RD-Bomb", "CWaves" and "Penrose" screen savers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal Written by Jamie Zawinski.
