Comment=A Voronoi tessellation. Periodically zooms in and adds new points. The existing points also wander around. There are a set of control points on the plane, each at the center of a colored cell. Every pixel within that cell is closer to that cell's control point than to any other control point. That is what determines the cell's shapes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation Written by Jamie Zawinski.
