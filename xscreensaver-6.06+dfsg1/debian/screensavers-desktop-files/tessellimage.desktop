Comment=Converts an image to triangles using Delaunay tessellation, or to polygons using Voronoi tesselation, and animates the result at various depths. More polygons are allocated to visually complex parts of the image. This is accomplished by first computing the first derivative of the image: the distance between each pixel and its neighbors (which is essentially edge detection or embossing). Then the Delaunay or Voronoi control points are chosen by selecting those pixels whose distance value is above a certain threshold: those are the pixels that have the largest change in color/brightness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation Written by Jamie Zawinski.
